## Luiz Santos

Hi, I'm Luiz! I'm a Brazilian junior full-stack software engineer living in London. I've completed an internship at the legal consulting start-up LawAdvisor and recently graduated from the full-stack bootcamp Makers Academy.

During my internship at LawAdvisor, I primarily used Elixir and Phoenix, but I feel comfortable working with in JavaScript/React and Ruby/Rails.

## Background

Prior to studying software engineering, I spent three years as the manager of a Japanese restaurant, where I became a certified Japanese sake sommelier and even spent a few months in rural Japan. During this time, I honed my interpersonal communication and teamwork skills, often being responsible for the entire restaurant's operations.

Although I'm currently based in London, I've also lived in Brazil, Portugal, and Japan, causing me to be adaptable by nature. Forced to think creatively to express myself in foreign countries, I've learned the importance of asking 'why' before 'how', and I always strive to comprehend the logic driving 'why' first when faced with new concepts. These experiences drove my passion for tackling new languages, whether they be human languages or programming languages. 

I leveraged this during my time at Makers, a language-agnostic bootcamp, to become versed in JavaScript, Ruby, React, Node, Sinatra, Jest, RSpec, Mongodb, PostgreSQL, Express, HTML, TDD, OOP, Agile, MVC, CSS.
