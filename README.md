## :technologist: Luiz Santos

I’m a London-based Brazilian software engineer working at Cimple, which operates a B2B e-procurement platform. At Cimple, I primarily use TypeScript, Elixir, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and AWS. After interning at LawAdvisor, a legal tech firm, and graduating from Makers, a coding bootcamp, I am also proficient in languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React.

## Background

Although I'm currently based in London, I've also lived in Brazil, Portugal, and Japan, causing me to be adaptable by nature. Forced to think creatively to express myself in foreign countries, I've learned the importance of asking 'why' before 'how', and I always strive to comprehend the logic driving 'why' first when faced with new concepts. These experiences drove my passion for tackling new languages, whether they be human languages or programming languages. 


During my time at Makers, a language-agnostic bootcamp, I leveraged a diverse skill set in JavaScript, Ruby, React, Node, Sinatra, Jest, RSpec, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express, HTML, TDD, OOP, Agile, MVC, and CSS. Additionally, at Cimple, as a software engineer, I specialized in TypeScript, Elixir, React, and GraphQL, leading successful projects in end-to-end testing and UI development.
